# sqlalchemy-challenge
This repository contains the jupyter notebook file with climate analysis, the climate app, the png file and a Resources folder with 2 csv files and an sqlite file. Most of the code was developped based on the excercises reviewed in class during Module 10 of the Bootcamp. I have also searched for code in Copilot and Stackoverflow.
It is important to highlight that I was not able to run the app.py with the VS Code terminal. However, I was able to run it using Git Bash and seeing the results in Thunder Client.
